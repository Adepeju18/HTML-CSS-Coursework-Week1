      <h1>lorem ipsum</h1>
      <p>Designers use Lorem Ipsum as a dummy text, something to cover the fact that content is missing from the design. </br>“Lorem Ipsum” is followed by more Latin text, making it easy for users or other designers to ignore it and imagine something more familiar or relevant in its place.</br>

        Even before the internet was a thing, people already used Lorem Ipsum as a filler in printing tests. </p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Nietzsche Ipsum: The birth of tragically cool filler text</h2>
<p class="card-text">If Monty Python is too childish for you, here is another cool alternative to Lorem Ipsum: Nietzsche Ipsum. </br>The German philosopher from 1800s is still very relevant today.</br> Regardless of how you feel towards his philosophy, there is no denying that his words are elegant and still have impact.</p>

      <h2>Batman Ipsum: WHERE is the cool text?</h2>
      <p>Batman has been a beloved hero across the world for decades, his grip on our hearts having only increased with the Dark Knight Trilogy. </br>Even if you’re not a big Batman fan, surely you can still appreciate that the screenwriters did a great job. </br>Talk about deep dialogues for a superhero movie!</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h2>Obama Ipsum: yes we can (have awesome text)!</h2>
      <p>No matter what your political opinions of Obama are, very few people out there can say his speeches were poorly written. </br>The man knew how to make a speech! Always bringing in emotion, making a moral stand or inspiring unity – Obama’s speeches had it all.</br>

        So, why not use his wise words instead of Lorem Ipsum? </br>Obama Ipsum is bound to make your product feel more real, as it will include current issues and debates that are still on-going, even with the radical change in administration.</p>
